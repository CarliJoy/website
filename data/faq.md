## When and where is EuroPython 2022 taking place?

After 2 years of being fully remote, EuroPython 2022 will be held on 11th-17th
July and it will be both in person and virtual.

The in-person conference will be held at The Convention Centre Dublin (The CCD)
in Dublin, Ireland.

For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a later
time.

## What will the schedule look like?

The conference will be organised in three phases:

- Monday & Tuesday (11.07 & 12.07): workshops and tutorials
- Wednesday - Friday (13.07 - 15.07): main conference days
- Saturday & Sunday (16.07 & 17.07): sprints (hackathon)

As usual, there will be several ticket options, so you can choose the one most
suitable for you. Details will be announced at the end of February.

## What will the program look like?

To get an idea of what to expect, please have a look at the
[EP2021 program](https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/sessions/) and the
[EP2019 program](https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/sessions/).

To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated based
on the input from the community voting. Make sure to subscribe to our
[EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) for updates.

## When will you start accepting talk proposals?

The Call for Proposals (CFP) will be launched in early March. We are thrilled to
receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to our community.

Especially if you are considering becoming a speaker for the first time, or if
you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to send in
your proposals. There is a speaker mentorship program as well as broader support
options. Make sure to subscribe to our
[EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) for updates.

If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing your
proposal! For more insights, please have a look at the EP2019 CFP page, which
was our last in-person conference. Some details may change for EP2022, but
overall, the structure is going to be similar.

## When will ticket sales start?

Ticket sales will start in March. Make sure to subscribe to our
[EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup) where the opening
dates will be announced on 28 February.

## What will the ticket prices be like?

We are aiming to keep the ticket prices similar to the last in-person conference
in 2019, though an increase could be necessary due to cost increases and the
consequences of the pandemic.

As always, we will announce these on our
[EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup)

## Will there be a Financial Aid program for EP2022?

Yes, we will have a Financial Aid program this year similar to the one we had in
2019\. Please watch out for announcements on the
[EuroPython Blog](https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup)

## How soon should I book accommodation and flights?

The time and location of the conference have been set, so you can book at any
time. We would recommend you consider flexible bookings in case of any changes
of plans in the future as well as appropriate insurance cover.

## When can sponsors start signing up?

Please check
[2019 Sponsor Packages](https://ep2019.europython.eu/sponsor/packages/) to get
an idea of the sponsorship options. The packages are not finalised yet, but will
be similar to what we had in 2019\. Sponsors who sign up early will again
receive a 10% discount.

We are committed to making EuroPython sponsorship accessible to most
organisations keen to help the community.

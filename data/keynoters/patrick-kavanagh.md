title:
  Python's role in unlocking the secrets of the Universe with the James Webb
  Space Telescope
speaker: Dr. Patrick Kavanagh
bio: Dr. Patrick Kavanagh is an astrophysicist and software developer based at
  the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS). He is an expert in
  high-energy studies of supernova remnants, superbubbles and the hot
  interstellar medium.


  Since moving to DIAS he has worked on the development of calibration and
  software tools for the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on Webb. MIRI is an
  international project comprising a consortium of European partner institutes,
  including DIAS, the European Space Agency, and partners in the US.


  He works on many aspects of MIRI including the calibration of the MIRI Medium
  Resolution Spectrometer, development of the MIRI simulator, MIRI commissioning
  activities and analysis tools, and will support MIRI commissioning at the Webb
  Mission Operations Center at the Space Telescope Science Institute in
  Baltimore.

The James Webb Space Telescope is a groundbreaking infrared observatory
resulting from an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space
Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. It was successfully launched on Christmas
Day 2021 from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, and is currently
orbiting the L2 point 1.5 million km from Earth.

Webb was designed to address some of the biggest questions in astronomy and
astrophysics, including identifying the first stars in the Universe, observing
the first galaxies, revealing the initial stages of star and planet formation,
and probing the composition of exoplanet atmospheres.

But how do we go from the raw data collected by Webb to science-ready data
products delivered to astronomers and astrophysicists around the world? How do
we embed our understanding of the telescope and its instruments into this
process? How did we prepare and test this?

From instrument simulators to the ambitious Webb Calibration Pipeline, the
software suites that support these tasks are written in Python. In this talk I
will give an overview of Webb, the crucial role of Python in Webb's development
and data processing, and I will show and discuss the first publicly released
images from this revolutionary telescope.

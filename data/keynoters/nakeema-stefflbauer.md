If real life was a superhero movie, we’d have all the ingredients needed for a hero’s rescue. So many “AI” algorithms are being applied to EU education, employment, and public safety systems that you might wonder if the TV series “Black Mirror” is fiction or a blueprint for nefarious actors. Luckily, there are codes to keep dystopia at bay, whether from the fictional Justice League or from real-life courts of justice. This talk discusses both, and is aimed at software engineers, architects, designers, testers and product/project managers who want to slow the Automation of Everything, but don’t know how.

## What Is Trans\*Code? ##

After nearly 3 years of hiatus, [Trans\*Code](https://www.trans.tech/) will be returning! We are delighted that EuroPython will be hosting a Trans*Code event in Dublin in July!

Trans\*Code is an international hack event series focused solely on drawing attention to transgender issues and opportunities. Trans*Code events aim to help draw attention to transgender issues through informal, topic-focused hackdays. Coders, designers, activists, and community members not currently working in technology are also encouraged to participate.

## Trans*Code @ EuroPython ##

The Trans\*Code event at EuroPython will take place on **Tuesday 12 July, 2022**.

It is a free full day workshop & hackday open to trans and non-binary folk, allies, coders, designers and visionaries of all sorts.

We will inform you of acceptance by email within 7 days of your application

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to the wonderful Trans\*Code team: [trans_code@europython.eu](mailto:trans_code@europython.eu)

### Bring Your Ideas! ###

Please bring your ideas! Trans\*Code is meant to be a place to explore ideas and technology relevant to trans and non-binary people. If you have any idea at all that you've wanted to explore, and app that you've wished existed, weâ€™d love to share it at Trans*Code!

### Why Should I Feel Safe at Trans*Code? ###

Trans\*Code is organised by trans people, for trans people. We know what feeling unsafe can be like, and we will do whatever we can to ensure your safety.

Our commitment is to make you feel safe and included, and we will call out anything or anyone that puts that in jeopardy.

It follows that if you need specific accommodations or there is anything you are concerned about, please raise it with Naomi Ceder or one of our other organisers and we will do whatever we can to help.

For this Trans*Code event we are partnering with EuroPython who also strive to offer a safe space for all people, including trans folks.

It is probably also worth mentioning that, in addition to the Trans*Code organisers, the EuroPython Code of Conduct committee includes a trans person, [Naomi Ceder](mailto:naomi@europython.eu). Check out our [Code of Conduct]( https://www.europython-society.org/coc/) for details.

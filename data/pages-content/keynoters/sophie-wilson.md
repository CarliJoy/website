speaker: Sophie Wilson

bio: Since her teenage years, Sophie has designed and built microprocessor based systems. Early projects included a system for counting translucent drops of liquid and detecting spun fibre machinery breakdowns; while in her first university vacation she developed an automated cow-feeder.

After university she joined Acorn Computers Ltd, where she designed the Acorn System 1, coding the operating system in binary before designing and implementing Acorn Assembler, Acorn MOS and BASIC. She, and her Acorn colleague Steve Furber, took less than a week to design and implement the prototype of the BBC Microcomputer, winning Acorn the contract for the BBC's Computer Literacy Project. Sophie designed the operating system and designed and implemented BBC BASIC for a succession of processors. Anyone alive in Europe in the 1980s will have encountered her work, such was the ubiquity of the BBC Microcomputer, and BBC BASIC is rightly celebrated as an example of a powerful programming language that is also easy for beginner coders to learn (not unlike another programming language with which we're all familiar).

She and Furber went on to co-design the ARM processor, powering Acorn's computers during the 1990s and virtually every mobile phone and tablet in the world today – 200 billion sales of ARM powered chips (as of July 2022). Acorn's CEO at the time, Hermann Hauser, recalls that "while IBM spent months simulating their instruction sets on large mainframes, Sophie did it all in her brain." MicroPython, CircuitPython and Snek all target ARM processors, and most modern Apple Macs run on chips based upon the ARM design. There's a good chance you're reading this announcement on a machine running an ARM processor based on Sophie’s design.

As if that were not enough, as a founder at Element 14, Sophie went on to develop the Firepath processor, widely used in the telecommunications industry. Broadcom acquired Element 14 in 2000.

Sophie is a Broadcom Fellow and Distinguished Engineer, a Fellow of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society, a Fellow of the Women’s Engineering Society, an honorary Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge, an honorary Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) and an honorary Fellow of the Institution of Engineering Designers (HonFIED). She has an honorary doctorate of science from Cambridge University and is a Commander of the British Empire (CBE).

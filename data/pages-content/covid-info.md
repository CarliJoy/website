# Covid Information

Hey Pythonistas! If youâ€™re interested in attending EuroPython 2022 in Dublin,
Ireland, we have prepared some information about COVID-19 related health
measures. We are committed to organising a safe conference and will comply with all safety protocols the Irish Government set out.

_NOTE:_ Given the constantly changing situation of COVID-19, the information can
change at any time and without warning; so could the capacity and restrictions
at the venue. The organisers will try to provide up to date information on this
page, but it is always better to refer to the
[official guidelines from the Irish Government](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/77952-government-advice-on-international-travel/).
For any major changes, we will post the updates on our news channels. Stay
Tuned!

## Travelling to Ireland

From Sunday 6 March 2022, people arriving in Ireland are no longer required to
show proof of vaccination, proof of recovery or a negative PCR test result upon
arrival. There are no post-arrival testing or quarantine requirements for
travellers to Ireland. Any individual that develops COVID-19 symptoms while in
Ireland should follow the HSE guidance in relation to
[isolation](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/restricted-movements/) and
undertaking
[antigen or PCR testing](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/testing/) as
appropriate.

## The rules and protocols by Law & The CCD

For conferences, the majority of COVID-19 restrictions at the venue have been
lifted:

- The CCD staff will wear face-masks;
- Alcohol-based hand-sanitizer dispensers will be available throughout the building;
- no mandatory mask for attendees;
- no additional check of vaccination status;
- no restrictions for lunches and/or coffee breaks;
- no social distancing needed when queuing or for any seating arrangements;
- no capacity limit.

## Strong Recommendations

Though the majority of COVID restrictions have been lifted, and you are not legally required to wear face-masks at the conference, we strongly recommend that you do, whenever possible. You are encouraged to bring your own mask. Should you forget or lose your own mask, we have a supply of 1000 surgical masks for emergency across days. We will also have sanitisers across the venue. Please use them.

As of 7 March 2022 social distancing is not required. We will have stickers indicating people's comfort level for interaction:

Please respect the choices of your fellow attendees if they ask you to keep your distance from them.

We strongly encourage you to take all the health precautionary measures you can
to protect yourself and those around us. Thanks!

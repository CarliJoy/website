# Voting

We'd like to hear your feedback about what would you like to see more of on the conference!

Everyone who attended EuroPython in the past (since 2015) or has bought a ticket or sent a proposal for EuroPython 2022 is eligible for voting.

## How talk voting works

The talk voting page will list all submitted proposals, including talks, tutorials and posters.

Please note that your own submissions will not be listed.

The voting will open as soon as the CFP is finished.

## Talk selection

After the talk voting phase, the EuroPython Program Team will use the votes to select the talks and build a schedule.

The talk voting is a good and strong indicator what participants are interested to see.
Submissions are selected by the Program Team based on editorial criteria to e.g. increase diversity, give a chance to less mainstream topics as well as avoiding too much of the same topic.

In general, the Program Team will try to give as many speakers a chance to talk as possible. If speakers have submitted multiple talks, the one with the highest rating will most likely get selected.

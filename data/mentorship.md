# Speaker Mentorship Program

In the EuroPython community, we emphasize the importance of diversity and
inclusion. We also encourage and support potential first-time speakers. To help
us achieve this goal, we will have the Speaker Mentorship program for
EuroPython 2022.

We are looking for mentors and mentees of the Speaker Mentorship Program of
EuroPython 2022.

_Applications will remain open until March 20, 2022 (Sunday)._

The mentorship program can be summarized into two types of activities:

## One to One Mentorship Program

A mentee from the underrepresented or marginalized group in the tech industry
will be matched with an experienced speaker.

## Webinar Workshops

### Ask Me Anything about CFP workshop - 23 March 2022 (Wednesday):

We encourage anyone who has no or little experience submitting to EuroPython's
CFP to join and ask questions. Questions can range from talk ideas, what makes a
good proposal to what is the selection process of the talk. Recording of the
session can be found here.

### First Time Speaker Workshop - TBA:

EuroPython will provide a speaker training session to all selected speakers
regarding how to set up the technology required to present at EuroPython.
However, we would like to give more support to first-time speakers on how to
prepare their talk and on what to expect when giving a live talk at EuroPython.

## Mentors

To become a Mentor you need to fill in the application form
[here](https://forms.gle/QLfWU9bj1y5GRm219):

We expect mentors to have past speaking experience at conferences similar to
EuroPython.

For mentors who took on a mentee, you are expected to provide 4 one-hour
sessions with your mentee to:

- Prepare their CFP submission
- Review their CFP before submission
- If the mentee is selected, help them prepare the talk. If the mentee is not
  selected, help them submit to another meetup/conference.
- Help mentee to rehearse for their talk
- You will also be invited to join the panel of the Webinar Workshops

## Mentee

If you are from an underrepresented or a marginalized group in the tech industry
and have no prior speaking experience, but would like to submit to EuroPython
2022, please fill in the form [here](https://forms.gle/QLfWU9bj1y5GRm219)

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">FAQ</h1>

    <h2>When and where is EuroPython 2022 taking place?</h2>

    <p>
      After 2 years of being fully remote, EuroPython 2022 will be held on
      11th-17th July and it will be both in person and virtual.
    </p>

    <p>
      The in-person conference will be held at The Convention Centre Dublin (The
      CCD) in Dublin, Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the virtual conference, detailed instructions will be announced at a
      later time.
    </p>

    <h2>What will the schedule look like?</h2>

    <p>The conference will be organised in three phases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Monday &amp; Tuesday (11.07 &amp; 12.07): workshops and tutorials</li>
      <li>Wednesday - Friday (13.07 - 15.07): main conference days</li>
      <li>Saturday &amp; Sunday (16.07 &amp; 17.07): sprints (hackathon)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As usual, there will be several ticket options, so you can choose the one
      most suitable for you. Details will be announced at the end of February.
    </p>

    <h2>What will the program look like?</h2>

    <p>
      To get an idea of what to expect, please have a look at the
      <a href="https://ep2021.europython.eu/events/sessions/">EP2021 program</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://ep2019.europython.eu/events/sessions/">EP2019 program</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      To select talks, we run a Call for Proposals (CFP). Talks are then curated
      based on the input from the community voting. Make sure to subscribe to
      our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
      for updates.
    </p>

    <h2>When will you start accepting talk proposals?</h2>

    <p>
      The Call for Proposals (CFP) will be launched in early March. We are
      thrilled to receive proposals on any topic that could be of interest to
      our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially if you are considering becoming a speaker for the first time,
      or if you are from an underrepresented group, we strongly encourage you to
      send in your proposals. There is a speaker mentorship program as well as
      broader support options. Make sure to subscribe to our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
      for updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have something in mind, there is no better time to start preparing
      your proposal! For more insights, please have a look at the EP2019 CFP
      page, which was our last in-person conference. Some details may change for
      EP2022, but overall, the structure is going to be similar.
    </p>

    <h2>When will ticket sales start?</h2>

    <p>
      Ticket sales will start in March. Make sure to subscribe to our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
      where the opening dates will be announced on 28 February.
    </p>

    <h2>What will the ticket prices be like?</h2>

    <p>
      We are aiming to keep the ticket prices similar to the last in-person
      conference in 2019, though an increase could be necessary due to cost
      increases and the consequences of the pandemic.
    </p>

    <p>
      As always, we will announce these on our
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Will there be a Financial Aid program for EP2022?</h2>

    <p>
      Yes, we will have a Financial Aid program this year similar to the one we
      had in 2019. Please watch out for announcements on the
      <a href="https://blog.europython.eu/#/portal/signup">EuroPython Blog</a>
    </p>

    <h2>How soon should I book accommodation and flights?</h2>

    <p>
      The time and location of the conference have been set, so you can book at
      any time. We would recommend you consider flexible bookings in case of any
      changes of plans in the future as well as appropriate insurance cover.
    </p>

    <h2>When can sponsors start signing up?</h2>

    <p>
      Please check
      <a href="https://ep2019.europython.eu/sponsor/packages/"
        >2019 Sponsor Packages</a
      >
      to get an idea of the sponsorship options. The packages are not finalised
      yet, but will be similar to what we had in 2019. Sponsors who sign up
      early will again receive a 10% discount.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are committed to making EuroPython sponsorship accessible to most
      organisations keen to help the community.

    <h2>COVID RELATED QUESTIONS</h2>

    <p>
      <strong
        >Note: Please bear in mind that the information in this section can
        change at any time and without warning. We will provide updates whenever
        there is a change.</strong

    </p>

    <h2>
      Will I get a ticket refund or exchange if I cannot travel due to COVID
      restrictions?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Travelling can be expected to be complicated during a pandemic. We will
      aim to offer a full refund of the conference ticket if your circumstances
      change.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you need a refund after this date, please contact us at
      board@europython.eu
    </p>

    <h2>Will there be any COVID safety precautions at the venue?</h2>

    <p>
      We will follow the
      <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/c36c85-covid-19-coronavirus/"
        >Government of Ireland’s guidelines</a
      >
      and there will be appropriate safety precautions at the venue. As of 21
      January 2022, the venue is operating at full capacity. The majority of
      COVID restrictions have been lifted and the only restriction that remains
      is that hospitality staff must still wear masks.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I need to wear a mask during the conference?</h2>

    <p>
      You are not required to wear a mask but please be mindful of people who
      want to do so. Risk is perceived differently by people and you should
      respect their choice.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I need to keep social distance during the conference?</h2>

    <p>
      No, as of 21 January 2022 social distancing is not required. Please
      respect the choices of your fellow attendees if they ask you to keep your
      distance from them.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I need to be vaccinated to attend the conference in person?</h2>

    <p>
      No, as of 21 January 2022 you are not required to be vaccinated to attend
      the conference. However, vaccination might be required at the border when
      you enter Ireland. More information can be found on the
